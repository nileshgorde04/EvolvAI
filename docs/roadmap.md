# ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements & Roadmap

EvolvAI has a solid foundation, but there are many exciting features planned for the future to make it even more powerful.

-   **Insights Page:** A dedicated analytics page with long-term trend analysis and data correlation charts (e.g., sleep vs. productivity). Users will be able to filter by date ranges to see how they've evolved over time.

-   **Blog Explorer:** An AI-powered content recommendation engine that suggests articles, videos, and books based on a user's specific goals and recent mood patterns.

-   **Weekly AI Summaries:** A feature to generate a comprehensive, personalized summary of the user's week, delivered via the AI Chat or a notification. This summary will highlight wins, identify recurring challenges, and provide one key piece of advice for the week ahead.

-   **Mobile App:** Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android to provide a seamless, on-the-go experience.

-   **Integrations:** Allow users to connect with other services like Google Calendar (to analyze how events affect their mood) or fitness trackers (to correlate physical activity with well-being).
